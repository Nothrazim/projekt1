This is a little text-based game where you manage a group of individuals ("players") who face different challenges ("adventure scenes") as they search for their destination. The player instances are distinguished from one another by their class and class type - and it is this class type that is most important in the game.
Each class type has a different chance of succeeding at the various challenges, from outright impossible to an automatic success.

The length of the printed text bears a mention. Due to limitations in monitor size, certain sentances may appear to be cut rather abruptly to begin on a new line. This is a minor annoyance, but does not impact the functionality of the game.

The code in it's entirety is roughly 800 lines, but this includes the many print lines. Disregarding those and comments, it is roughly 400 lines.

With the exception for player and party names, the game is entirely reliant upon inputting numbers from 1-12 (depending on choices in the game).
